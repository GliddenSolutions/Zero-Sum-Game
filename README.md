# Zero-Sum-Game
Hi! Thanks for checking out the Zero Sum Game, but, unfortunately the ~~princess is in another castle~~ I mean the code is in another private repo per client requests.  
We can go through the code together, I'd love to hear feedback and any suggestions on how to improve it!  

Tech Stack:  
* AWS (SAM)
  * DynamoDB
  * API Gateway
  * CloudFormation
  * Lambda

* JavaScript
  * Vite
  * React
  * Express (for local development/testing)

The Frontend is deployed to Firebase and the Backend is via AWS API calls.  

There's some more cool tech that goes into this feel free to reach out!
